## Transect data at Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary

### About data set 
The data set was collected in wildlife Sanctuary and adjacent community-managed lands in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh by Velho et al. (2015). This data set can be used for addressing scientific questions such as how village, road and conservation efforts affect the species richness or abundance, which can provide basic info for wildlife conservation and management.
### The description of data set
The data set include eight variable such as transect, regime, distance to village,distance to road, axis scores, species, repeat categories, number of signs per species.
Among them, nmds are the axis scores from axis 1 of our Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) and are used as a disturbance axis.  There were 450 observations for each variable.  
### The license or terms of use 
The data set can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission. The detailed terms of use is as [following link](http://datadryad.org/pages/policies).

### Potential data users and decision-makers for this data
The data may be valuable and important for Ministry of Environment & Forests, Government of India, local and domestic or international conservation agency or scientist.
### Three questions this data might help to answer
* Are there difference in species richness and abundance between protected  and non-protected area?
* Does village affect species richness and abundance?
* Does road affect species richness and abundance?
