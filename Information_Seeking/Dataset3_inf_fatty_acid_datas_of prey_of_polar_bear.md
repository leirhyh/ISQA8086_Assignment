## The fatty acid data of prey of polar bear (_Ursus maritimus_)

### About data set 
The data set was collected for Adipose tissue harvested by 103 polar bears. This data set can be used for diet analyses of polar bear and compare the diet variation in different season and other animals such as seal, whale, which can be important and valuable information for Zoologist and research or scientists on animal diet.  

### The description of data set
The data set include 111 rows and ten columns as  follows:  

* Region
* Season
* Age
* Sex
* 30 fatty acid factors such as c16.2w6, c16.2w4, c16.3w6, c16.3w4, c16.4w3, c16.4w1, c18.2w6, c18.3w6, c18.3w4, c18.3w3, c18.3w1, c18.4w3, c18.4w1, c20.1w9, c20.1w7, c20.2w6, c20.3w6, c20.4w6,	c20.3w3, c20.4w3, c20.5w3, c22.1w11, c22.1w9, c22.1w7, c21.5w3, c22.4w6, c22.5w6, c22.4w3, c22.5w3, c22.6w3

### Potential data users and decision-makers for this data
The data may be valuable and important for researchers or scientists who study the diet of wildlife, zoologist for animal diet and animal diet company  
### Three questions this data might help to answer
* Does the diet of polar bear change with different seasons?
* Are there difference between male or female in diet?
* Are there difference between polar bear and other animals such as seal and whale?*
