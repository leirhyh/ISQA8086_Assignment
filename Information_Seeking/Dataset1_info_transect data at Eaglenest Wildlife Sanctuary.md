## Transect data at Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary

### About data set 
The data set was collected in wildlife Sanctuary and adjacent community-managed lands in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh by Velho et al. (2015). This data set can be used for addressing scientific questions such as how village, road and conservation efforts affect the species richness or abundance, which can provide basic info for wildlife conservation and management.
### The description of data set
The data set include 450 rows and eight columns as follows:  

* Transect
* Regime
* Distance to village
* Distance to road
* Axis scores: nmds are the axis scores from axis 1 of our Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) and are used as a disturbance axis. 
* Species
* Repeat categories
* The number of signs per species  

Detailed info about the data can be found in the paper of reference.  


### The license or terms of use 
The data set is under license of CC0 1.0. The data set can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission. To the extent possible under law, the authors have waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to this data.

### Potential data users and decision-makers for this data
The data may be valuable and important for Ministry of Environment & Forests, Government of India, local and domestic or international conservation agency or scientist.
### Three questions this data might help to answer
* Are there difference in species richness and abundance between protected  and non-protected area?
* Does village affect species richness and abundance?
* Does road affect species richness and abundance?
