## The cough recordings of different treatments in 24hours

### About data set 
The data set was collected cough frequency throughout the data and in response to tuberculosis therapy for 64 human immunodeficiency virus–negative adults a new diagnosis of culture-proven, drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis. The data set can use for evaluating the circadian cycle of cough, cough frequency risk factors, and the impact of appropriate treatment on cough and bacillary load, Which can be valuable information for who study or control the Tuberculosis and other related disease and contagious disease. 

### The description of data set
The data set include 6408 rows and ten columns as  follows:  

* Participant’s code
* The day of treatment
* The target day
* The length of the recording in hours
* Validation or discover
* Time frame for the recording
* The number of hour during the time frame
* The number of cough events in an hour
* The number of cough episodes in an hour
* The number of cough episodes in a day  

Detailed info about the data can be found in the paper of reference
### The license or terms of use 
The data set can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission. The detailed terms of use is as [following link](http://datadryad.org/pages/policies).

### Potential data users and decision-makers for this data
The data may be valuable and important for researchers or scientists who study the Tuberculosis and other related disease, contagious disease control agency and health organization. 
### Three questions this data might help to answer
* For Pulmonary Tuberculosis patients, do they cough more in different periods in a day?
* For Pulmonary Tuberculosis patients, do the treatments reduce the frequency of coughing and which treatment strategy of time is better?
* Do the treatments reduce the potential for airborne tuberculosis transmission?
