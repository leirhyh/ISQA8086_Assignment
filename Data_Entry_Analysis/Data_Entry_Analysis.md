* density should be Density with unit such as #/mm.
* Temp should be with unit such as °C or °F.
* Colony Diameter should have unit, which should be mm.
* Variable Z should be changed to depth with unit such as m. 
* There should be note for cell colored with yellow.
## problems in File 2 (zoop-temp-main)
* Cuni #/L don't know what it is mean.
* Chippo #/L don't know what it is mean.
* Temp should be with unit such as °C or °F.
* The figure don't have label of y axis.
* The figure doesn't have title to explain what this graph is.
* There should be note for *.
* There should be note for cell colored with yellow and red.
* Chla for Chlorophyll a is still not clear.

## Problems in File 3 (zoop)
* There should be note for cell colored with red.
* Cuni #/L don't know what it is mean.
* Chippo #/L don't know what it is mean.
* For Chippo #/L, there were two cell less than 0, which are mistakes.
* The graph was lack of label for x and y axis.
* Without note, the calculation labeled as 7th and 9th is meaningless
* Temp should be with unit such as °C or °F.
* Chla for Chlorophyll a is still not clear.
* The calculation of Max Depth for 72m is wrong
* Depth need to be labeled with unit of m.
* Temp should be with unit such as °C or °F.
